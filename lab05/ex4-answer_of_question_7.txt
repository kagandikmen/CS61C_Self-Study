7. Answer the following question:

If we decide to take the input and interpret it as a 2’s Complement number, 
what inputs will produce Out1 = 1? Hint: What do the first and last bits of a 2’s 
Complement number being 1 tell you about the number?

ANSWER:

That the first and the last bits of a Two's Complement number are both 1 means
that it is a negative odd integer. Negative because its MSB is 1, and odd because
its LSB is 1.
