-----EXERCISE 1-----

minimum allowable clock time = c2q + critical path + setup
                             = 10 ns + (45 ns + 60 ns) + 10 ns
                             = 125 ns

maximum allowable clock rate = 1 / (125 ns) 
                             = 8 MHz


-----EXERCISE 2-----

minimum allowable clock time = c2q + critical path + setup
                             = 10 ns + 60 ns + 10 ns
                             = 80 ns

maximum allowable clock rate = 1 / (80 ns) 
                             = 12.5 MHz

Bubbles are unnecessary here, because we don't use the result of
the addition in the multiplication. All of the numbers we use
to multiply are already ready, we don't need a value that will
be changed by an instruction still in process.
