Exercise 1 Checkoff Questions:
    1. We go to the TLB, TLB doesn't have any entry (TLB miss), we go to the page memory,
        page table is in its unmodified state, valid bit for the page is 0, so we have to go to
        the disk and load the corresponding page. After we load the page in the memory, we have
        their physical address, depending on which page on the memory we have chosen to load on.
    2. Because there are 8 pages in the virtual memory. One needs 3 bits to address them.
        However, the memory has 4 pages and therefore only 2 bits are needed for addressing.

Exercise 4 Checkoff Question:
    1. The percentage is higher, because the TLB is zeroed out at each context switch. Each process
        fills out the TLB for (around) 4 memory accesses, but right after that, a context switch happens
        and the next process begins with a zeroed out TLB.
